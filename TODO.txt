                 The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. 
                 The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations
                 if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. 
                 The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.  index.html
    
  Don't really know why. It is coming from the imported library. Maybe we should include it natively in our source
